Pode is a Cross-Platform framework, *completely written in PowerShell*, for creating web servers to host [REST APIs](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Routes/Overview/), [Web Pages](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Routes/Examples/WebPages/), and [SMTP/TCP](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/SmtpServer/) Servers. Pode also allows you to render dynamic files using [`.pode`](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Views/Pode/) files, which are just embedded PowerShell, or other [Third-Party](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Views/ThirdParty/) template engines. Plus many more features, including [Azure Functions](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Serverless/Types/AzureFunctions/) and [AWS Lambda](https://badgerati.github.io/Pode/Tutorials/Serverless/Types/AwsLambda/) support!
